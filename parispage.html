	    <p><img src="paris.jpg" width="250" height="170" alt=""/>Nowhere else on earth makes the heart swoon like the mention of Paris. The city lures with its magnificent art, architecture, culture, and cuisine, but there’s also a quieter magic waiting to be explored: the quaint cobbled lanes, the sweet patisseries around the corner, and the cozy little bistros that beckon with a glass of Beaujolais. Get ready to make Paris your own.</p>
	    <p>For centuries Paris has been one of the world’s most important and attractive cities. It is appreciated for the opportunities it offers for business and commerce, for study, for culture, and for entertainment; its gastronomy, haute couture, painting, literature, and intellectual community especially enjoy an enviable reputation. Its sobriquet “the City of Light” (“la Ville Lumière”), earned during the Enlightenment, remains appropriate, for Paris has retained its importance as a centre for education and intellectual pursuits.</p>
	    <p>The best places to eat in Paris include: the Cristal Room Baccarat, Printemps Haussman Rooftoop Terrace Cafes, Rôtisserie du Beaujolais, and Chez Julien. The best places to stay are the 7th Arrondissement, the 18th Arrondissement, the 1st Arrondissement, and the 4th Arrondissement. The best things to do in Paris are: Wander Notre Dame, Visit the Eiffel Tower, Visit the Louvre, and Visit the Jardin des Tuileries. </p>
